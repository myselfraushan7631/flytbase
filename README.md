Problem Statement

Traditional security workflows are slow and fragmented. Operators must manually verify alerts, manage multiple tools, and document evidence—often under extreme pressure.

Design Approach

Situation-driven UI instead of static dashboards

AI-first decision support with human override at every step

Progressive disclosure of information based on urgency

One-system mindset for managing multiple drones and teams

Key Phases Covered

Alert → Assessment: AI validates threats and presents confidence-based insights.

Active Response: Operator sets intent; AI coordinates drones and teams.

Evidence Capture: Automated, continuous, legally-valid documentation.

Core Design Principles

Less UI, more intelligence

Trust through transparent AI actions

Automation without loss of human control

Minimal interactions for maximum impact

Outcome

The experience enables operators to respond within seconds instead of minutes, maintain situational awareness, and deliver complete evidence—without being overwhelmed.
